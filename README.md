# Automated Data Pipelines (ADP) Solution 
This repository contains the source code for Automated Data Pipelines boosterpack, developed in collaboration with [Canarie](https://www.canarie.ca/) organization. This solution demonstrates how we at [Intelius Analytics](https://www.intelius.ai) used tools and technologies such as Kubernetes, Apache Airflow, MySQL, FastAPI, Apache Kafka and React.js to solve the problem of developing an integrated framework from open-source libraries for creating automated data pipelines. \
For more information about this solution including how to deploy it, refer to the boosterpack documentation on the Canarie website (link to be provided after publishing the boosterpack) \
Also, you can refer to ReadMe files in each of the folder in this repository to learn more about the applications or tools used in this solution.
